# ProgBattle

Escape the Maze with Code

## Project Overview

ProgBattle is a full-stack web application for hosting a programming tournament. Participants form teams, write intelligent bot scripts, compete in matches, and climb the leaderboard. The project features user authentication, team management, bot submission and evaluation, a real-time game engine, and a frontend for match simulation and leaderboard viewing.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Cannot view any other page if not logged in 
- Round 1 (functional) and support for round-2 (non-functional) :( 
- Team creation, joining, and management (max 4 members per team)
- User can also leave the team as long as they are not the one who created the team
- Bot script upload and evaluation against system bots
- Real-time use of game engine (`engine.py`) for bot-vs-bot matches
- Scoring system: Win = 5 pts, Draw = 2 pts, Loss = 0 pts, +1 bonus for every 3 goals scored
- Enhanced leaderboard with:
  - Visual indicators for qualifying (üåü) and non-qualifying (‚ö†Ô∏è) positions
  - Clear status indicators for team progress
  - Tournament progression tracking
- Automation scripts for quick setup and testing:
  - `auto_setup.py`: Automatically create teams and users
  - `auto_submit_bots.py`: Automatically submit bots for all teams

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```

### 2. Run the Backend Server

```bash
cd server
python app.py
```

- The server runs on `http://localhost:5000/` by default.

### 3. Run the Game Engine Manually

```bash
python engine.py --p1 bot1.py --p2 bot1.py
```

- Produces `game_log.csv` for simulation.

### 4. Automated Setup (Optional)

To quickly set up multiple teams for testing:

```bash
# Create 20 teams automatically
python auto_setup.py

# Submit bots for all teams
python auto_submit_bots.py

# Monitor and trigger Round 2 qualification
python auto_qualify_teams.py
```

The auto setup script will:
- Create 20 teams with random names
- Generate usernames and passwords (password: "test123")
- Save credentials to `teams_credentials.txt`

The auto submit script will:
- Read teams from `teams_credentials.txt`
- Submit random bots until each team has 5 submissions
- Show submission results and scores

The auto qualify script will:
- Monitor team submission completion status
- Automatically trigger Round 2 qualification when all teams are ready
- Display the final qualification results with rankings
- Show which teams qualified for Round 2 (top 16)

### 5. Example: Submit a Bot via API

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/bot/submit"
files = {'bot_file': open("bot2.py", "rb")}
data = {'team_id': 1}

res = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
print(res.json())
```

## WORKINGS
- User first Registers then logins to the server, the username is taken as a unique identity and password is protected using python library werkzeug
- Then they are required to go to the Team section in order to either join a team or create one.
- Only after getting a team can user submit a bot, they can only submit 5 bots one by one.
- Submission result is shown instantaneously and user is allowed to download the log(csv) file.
- They can then use this csv file to view simulation by clicking on the simulation tab
- They can then view leaderboard which now shows:
  - üåü for teams in qualifying positions (top 16)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è for teams in elimination zone
  - Clear status indicators for qualification and matches remaining

## Scoring System & Rounds

### Scoring System
- Each time a team submits a bot, it is matched against the system bot (`bot1.py`) using the game engine.
- The scoring for each match is as follows:
  - **Win:** 5 points (if your bot scores more than the system bot)
  - **Draw:** 2 points (if both bots score equally)
  - **Loss:** 0 points (if your bot scores less than the system bot)
  - **Bonus:** +1 point for every 3 goals your bot scores in a match (e.g., 6 goals = +2 bonus)
- The final score for a submission is the sum of the base score (win/draw/loss) and any bonus points.
- After submission, the result (score, log file) is shown instantly, and the user can download the log (CSV) for simulation.

### Submission Limits
- In **Round 1**, each team can submit up to **5 bots** (matches) in total. Only these 5 submissions count towards qualification.

### Round System
- **Round 1:**
  - All teams compete against the system bot.
  - Each team can play up to 5 matches (submissions).
  - The **cumulative score** from these 5 matches determines the team's ranking on the leaderboard.
  - After all teams have played their matches, the top 16 teams (by total score) qualify for Round 2.

- **Round 2:**
  - (Support present, but not fully functional in this version)
  - Qualified teams are intended to compete against each other's bots in a tournament format.
  - The leaderboard for Round 2 would be based on these head-to-head matches.

- The leaderboard can be viewed at any time to see team rankings and qualification status.

All endpoints return JSON responses. You can also use tools like Postman for easier API testing.

## Database

The backend uses **SQLite** (file: `progbattle_new.db`) with SQLAlchemy ORM for data management. The database is responsible for storing users, teams, and bot submissions, and managing their relationships.

### Main Tables & Relationships

#### 1. **User**
- `id`: Integer, primary key
- `username`: String, unique
- `password_hash`: String
- **Relationships:**
  - Can belong to multiple teams (via association table)
  - Can own a team

#### 2. **Team**
- `id`: Integer, primary key
- `name`: String, unique
- `owner_id`: Foreign key to User
- `max_size`: Integer (default 4)
- `round`: Integer (1 or 2)
- `matches_played`: Integer
- `is_qualified`: Boolean (for round 2)
- `created_at`: DateTime
- **Relationships:**
  - Has multiple members (users)
  - Has multiple submissions

#### 3. **Submission**
- `id`: Integer, primary key
- `team_id`: Foreign key to Team
- `bot_path`: String (file path to uploaded bot)
- `score`: Integer (match score)
- `log_path`: String (file path to match log)
- `timestamp`: DateTime
- `round`: Integer (1 or 2)

#### 4. **team_members** (Association Table)
- Links users and teams (many-to-many relationship)

### How It Works

- When a user registers, a new `User` record is created.
- When a team is created, the creator becomes the owner and is added to the team.
- Users can join/leave teams (unless they are the owner).
- When a bot is submitted, a new `Submission` is created, linked to the team.
- The leaderboard and round progression are calculated from the `Submission` scores.

### Database Initialization

- Tables are created automatically on first run.
- No manual migration is needed for SQLite in development.

### User Authentication & Password Security

- **Username:**
  - Usernames are unique and stored as plain text in the database.

- **Password Storage:**
  - Passwords are **never stored in plain text**.
  - When a user registers, their password is hashed using Werkzeug's secure password hashing utilities (`generate_password_hash`).
  - Only the resulting hash is stored in the `password_hash` field of the `User` table.

- **Password Verification:**
  - During login, the submitted password is checked against the stored hash using `check_password_hash`.
  - This ensures that even if the database is compromised, raw passwords are not exposed.

## Note 
- I tried deploying the website to https://progbattle.onrender.com/ but I dont know how to fix this , for some reason it shows "an error occured" when I try to Register
- maybe it's not able to create the database or something
- added Demo video [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12VcVwi1txeUMGWzI5f9P30sDa5B1olhc/view?usp=sharing)
